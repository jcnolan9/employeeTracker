# employeeTracker

## Description
In this project I use the npm package Inquirer to ask a user what task they would like to accomplish with an employee database. The user can view the contents of the various tables
in the database (employee, role, department), they can add new employees to the database, add new roles in the company, and add new departments to the company. The user can also
update the role of an existing employee to a new role. Viewing or updating information from the MySQL database is done via database queries which are abstracted away from the end user.
All the user will know is that their desired task was accomplished without having to worry about writing the SQL queries themselves.
